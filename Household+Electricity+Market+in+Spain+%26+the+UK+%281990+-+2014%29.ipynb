    "The electricity consumption in the UK is higher than Spain due to weather conditions. Although there is a growth in the electricity consumption, in relative terms is lower than in Spain and there is a decline from 2005 to 2015 due to the economic incentives enforced in Europe for the electricity sector. Although Spain continues to grow during that period, the UK starts a decline due to lower natural gas prices."
